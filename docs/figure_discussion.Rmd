**Discussion:** While meso-scale blooms the size of Hawaii (big island) occur 
every year, blooms larger than $10,000 km^2$ occur semi-annually. These blooms 
tend to last approximately 20 - 100 days. A few blooms (2007, 2015, 2020) begin 
in the late summer, August - September, but persist until the winter where they 
are engulfed by the subtropical CHL front, making a true end date difficult to 
distinguish. Conversely some blooms notably 2005 and 2019 (Toyoda explains 
these), begin as the subtropical CHL front recedes and a true start date is 
difficult to distinguish. In some cases, 2007 and 2020 multiple large blooms

occur in a single year. 

Bloom magnitudes range from 0.17 - 3.00, with a median value of $0.67 [mg/m^2]$, 
approximately $\times 4.5$ the background $1-1.5 [mg/m^3]$. Some of the stronger
blooms occurred along 30N in 2011, 2007, and 2020. The magnitude of the raw

occurs towards the XXXX or the bloom's lifespan.

chlorophyll satellite signal does not taking into account the northward

magnitude that does correct for the northward chlorophyll gradient, the years
XXXX, XXXX had the strongest blooms which occurred at Stn. Aloha and 30N 
respectively. 

The area of the blooms range from $1.37 \times 10^4 [km^2]$ in 2012 to  
$9.43 \times 10^5 [km^2]$ in 2018. This excludes blooms less than 
$1 \times 10^5 [km^2]$ and those that are engulfed by the subtropical 
chlorophyll front. The blooms appear to cluster in three locations, that is, 
near Stn. ALOHA at [25N, -152W], at approximately [32N, 160W] and [32N, 140W].

# 2018 Case Study --------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 6:  k-means cluster analysis of (sub)mesoscale regions

**Discussion:** 

## Figure 5: Two late summer CHL blooms relationship to fronts and eddies

**Discussion:** Both blooms appear to be associated with frontal features with 
little apparent association to mesoscale eddies.

## Figure 8: Satellite-based time series of the 2018 bloom

Time-series progression of the onset and demise of the 2018 bloom in the NPSG. 
Black and grey lines (95% confidence interval) are a GAM smoother. Figure a) 
shows the surface, figure b) shows the biomass, and figure c) shows the depth 
integrated CHL concentration.

**Discussion:** 

## Figure 9: (Sub)mesoscale features across the lifespan of the 2018 bloom

Time-series of bloom percent association (deviation from the background) of bloom 
values to cyclonic eddies, anti-cyclonic eddies and frontal features. Percent 
association is the percent of each (sub)mesoscale regionâ€™s area that is 
associated with a bloom feature.
