## TO do:
  1. rerun sumtable for all years
  2. choose start and end dates by hand 
  3. rerun sumtable with weekly chl
  4. update duration bar plot, and bloom centers plot
  5. add chl anomaly to sumtable (30N too strong)
  6. monthly composites choose big blooms, have supplementary of all or video
  7. Cluster analysis on lat lon bloom centers
  8. Add backround signal to figure 9
  9. Add dates to figure 6
  10. add a color bar to all bloom plots
  11. fig 6 add eddy labesl, FSLE color bars, chl colobar
  12. fig 6 might not be subseting CHL correctly
  13. Change plots to not be bloom values just a 0.1 cut off of the anomaly. 
      It's difficult tot describe
