## General Processing

The CZZ boarders where used as a mask to remove the coastal effects in the CHL 
SLA, and FSLE data sets. Then a CHL anomaly was calculated by removing the 
seasonal effects and long term climatologic effects from the raw CHL satellite 
signal. CHL blooms values where identified as any point greater than the median
plus the MAD per grid cell (across time) of the CHL anomaly. 

## Table 1: Summary table of late summer CHL blooms in the NPSG

**Methods:** To identify when particularly large blooms occurred in an 
autonomous way, an STL filter was applied to the daily averaged time series of 
the CHL satellite data set. Bloom time periods were identified as any period 
above the mean and standard deviation of the residuals of the STL filter. 
Periods where the bloom received for shorter than 7 days where ignored and 
blooms that lasted longer than 14 days where chosen. Alternatively, start and 
end dates of the blooms where chosen manualy by viewing weekly chlorophyll maps. 
This proved to be more effective than a over engineered autonomous bloom 
identification process.

The bloom duration was found by subtracting the end from the start date. The 
magnitude was defined as the maximum value the CHL satellite signal reached at 
any point during the blooms. The bloom area was calculated as the maximum area 
the bloom reached. The center longitude and latitude locations where found by 
taking the average longitude and latitude location of each bloom point on the 
day the bloom reached it's maximum area. To mitigate the effects of clouds, the 
weekly chl product was used to find the bloom area and center. Blooms that 
occurred for less than two weeks where excluded.

**Discussion:** Frequency, magnitude, location, typical duration.

## Figure 1: Monthly Composites of $CHL_{sat}$ in the NPSG

Monthly images of CHL bloom values within the chosen study region of the NPSG. 
Each row shows a unique year, and the five late summer months in which the 
blooms occur. The Hawaiian islands are shown in the bottom left. Bloom values 
are found using the CHL anomaly product.

## Figure 2: Bloom centers and maximum area

Bloom centers for all summer to fall blooms that occur between 2003-2021. The 
area of each circle is equal to the maximum area each bloom reached, calculated 
from the 1-day L3 CHL product (erdMH1chla1day).

## Figure 3: Bloom duration and day of year

Bar plot of the bloom duration for all summer to fall blooms that occur between 
2003-2021. Start and end date of each bloom (table 1) found using an STL filter.
The length of each bar is equal to the duration described in table 1, as well as 
the start date of each bloom. The grey center line is the middle of each bloom, 
found as the mean of the bloom start and end date

## Figure 4: HPLC against Satellite CHL Comparison and CHL Climatologies

Comparison of High-pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) bottle samples against 
the GlobColor CHL1 Lm3 satellite product. The generalized linear regression 
(family = gamma) gives an $r^2$ value of $0.454$ with a significant fit 
($p < 0.05$). Figure b) a box plot of the average monthly CHL satellite signal 
across the 18 years of data. The light grey boxes are for the region at 30N, and 
the dark grey box is for the region around Stn. ALOHA.

## Figure 5:  k-means cluster analysis of (sub)mesoscale regions

K-means cluster analysis (method = euclidean distance, k = 4, scale = 0-1) 
applied to the FSLE, and SLA fields at St. ALOHA during the late summer months 
(July-October) of 2018. The cluster analysis groups each data point into one of 
four (sub)mesoscale regions: mesoscale positive, mesoscale negative, 
submesoscale, and mixed regions.

## Figure 6: Two late summer CHL blooms relationship to fronts and eddies

Plankton bloom for 2019 and 2020 overlaid by FSLE and eddies. Both blooms appear 
to be associated with frontal features with little apparent association to 
mesoscale eddies.

## Figure 7: Spatio-temporal evolution of the 2018 bloom

8 day composites showing the start and demise of the 2018 bloom in the NSPG. 
Bloom values are chosen using the CHL anomaly. Strong frontal features  from 
FSLE satellite data are shown as black lines. Day of the year is shown in the 
top left corner of each plot.

## Figure 8: Satellite-based time series of the 2018 bloom

Timeseries progression of the onset and demise of the 2018 bloom in the NPSG. 
Black and grey lines (95% confidence interval) are a GAM smoother. Figure a) 
shows the surface, figure b) shows the biomass, and figure c) shows the depth 
integrated CHL concentration.

## Figure 9: Spatial association of (sub)mesoscale features across the lifespan of the 2018 bloom

Timeseries of bloom percent association (deviation from the background) of bloom 
values to cyclonic eddies, anti-cyclonic eddies and frontal features. Percent 
association is the percent of each (sub)mesoscale regionâ€™s area that is 
associated with a bloom feature.
