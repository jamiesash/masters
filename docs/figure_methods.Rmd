# Pre-Processing ---------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Downbload: 

**Methods:** Argo-float data provided by Ifremer was accessed via the Erddap 
tableddap server (data-set id: ArgoFloats-synthetic-BGC) using the erddap 
packacge in R. 

Satellite chlorophyll data, provided by NOAA GEO, was accessed via the Erddap 
server (data-set id: erdMH1chla8day) using the erddap packacge in R. NOAA offers
a variety of sattelite CHL data sets For this study, the CHL data set used was 
the Aqua-MODIS 8-day (data-set id: erdMH1chla8day), with a data range of 
2003-01-06 to 2022-01-01.  

## General Processing

The CZZ boarders where used as a mask to remove the coastal effects in the CHL 
SLA, and FSLE data sets. Then a CHL anomaly was calculated by removing the 
seasonal effects and long term climatologic effects from the raw CHL satellite 
signal. CHL blooms values where identified as any point greater than the median
plus the MAD per grid cell (across time) of the CHL anomaly.

Comparison of High-pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) bottle samples against 
the GlobColor CHL1 Lm3 satellite product. The generalized linear regression 
(family = gamma) gives an $r^2$ value of $0.454$ with a significant fit 
($p < 0.05$). Figure b) a box plot of the average monthly CHL satellite signal 
across the 18 years of data. The light grey boxes are for the region at 30N, and 
the dark grey box is for the region around Stn. ALOHA.

# Characterizing CHL blooms ----------------------------------------------------

## Table 1: Summary table of late summer CHL blooms in the NPSG

**Methods:** To identify when particularly large blooms occurred in an 
autonomous way, an STL filter was applied to the daily averaged time series of 
the CHL satellite data set. Bloom time periods were identified as any period 
above the mean and standard deviation of the residuals of the STL filter. 
Periods where the bloom received for shorter than 7 days where ignored and 
blooms that lasted longer than 14 days where chosen. Alternatively, start and 
end dates of the blooms where chosen manualy by viewing weekly chlorophyll maps. 
This proved to be more effective than a over engineered autonomous bloom 
identification process.

The bloom duration was found by subtracting the end from the start date. The 
magnitude was defined as the maximum value the CHL satellite signal reached at 
any point during the blooms. The bloom area was calculated as the maximum area 
the bloom reached. The center longitude and latitude locations where found by 
taking the average longitude and latitude location of each bloom point on the 
day the bloom reached it's maximum area. To mitigate the effects of clouds, the 
weekly chl product was used to find the bloom area and center. Blooms that 
occurred for less than two weeks where excluded.

## Figure 1: Monthly Composites of $CHL_{sat}$ in the NPSG

**Methods:** To generate the monthly thumbnail plots of bloom values, monthly 
composites of CHL data were used, and bloom values from the late summer months 
from June - October were plotted.  

## Figure 2: Bloom centers and maximum area

**Methods:** Bloom center from table 1 where plotted along with their maximum 
area represented as circles. The area of each circle is equal to the maximum 
area each amorphic bloom reached.

## Figure 3: Bloom duration and day of year

**Methods:** Bar plot of the bloom duration for all summer to fall blooms that 
occur between 2003-2021. Start and end date of each bloom (table 1) found using 
an STL filter. The length of each bar is equal to the duration described in 
table 1, as well as the start date of each bloom. The grey center line is the 
date each bloom reached it's maximum magnitude. Blooms lasting less than 14 days
were omitted. 

# 2018 Case Study --------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 6:  k-means cluster analysis of (sub)mesoscale regions

**Methods:** To group the parameters into (sub)mesoscale categories, we take the
approach outlined by Gou et al. (40) where k-means clustering algorithm (k = 4) 
is used to group the SLA and FSLE data points into one of four physical regions 
based on the clusters centroid location in FSLE-SLA space (Figure 4) i.e. 
positive mesoscale (anti-cyclonic eddies), negative mesoscale (cyclonic eddies), 
sub-mesoscale (fronts) and mixed. 

We applied the k-means cluster analysis to the daily SLA and FSLE fields within 
the study region across the lifetime of the 2018 bloom: 2018-07-28 to 2018-10-15 
(Figure 5). Each group, 1-4, was assigned it's respective (sub)mesoscale region 
i.e. anti-cyclonic eddy regions (blue), cyclonic eddy regions (orange), frontal 
regions (yellow) and mixed regions (purple). 

## Figure 5: Two late summer CHL blooms relationship to fronts and eddies

Plankton bloom for 2019 and 2020 overlaid by FSLE and eddies. 

**Methods:** A weekly layer of the CHL satellite product that occurred closest 
to the date that the bloom reached it's maximum area was subset for the 2020 
bloom and the 2019 bloom. Only the bloom values where plotted. Cyclonic and 
anti-cyclonic eddies as well, as FSLE frontal features where overlaid on the CHL 
satellite product. Both cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies are plotted as black 
lines. 

## Figure 7: Spatio-temporal evolution of the 2018 bloom

**Methods:** The 8-day CHL product was used to plot the weekly layers of the 
bloom values across the lifespan of the 2018 bloom. Strong frontal features i.e. 
FSLE values greater than the mean plus the standard deviations  of the daily 
FSLE field were over laid on the bloom points.

## Figure 8: Satellite-based time series of the 2018 bloom

**Methods:** Daily surface area, integrated chlorophyll biomass, and chlorophyll 
concentration where calculated using the methods outlined in Lehan et al. 2006. 
Chlorophyll biomass was integrated spatially and verticaly across daily estimates 
of the mixed layer depth (MLD). The MLD was calculated using the method derived 
by Chu and Fan 2010. The chlorophyll concentration was found as the mean 
chlorophyll signal over the daily surface area of the bloom patch. 

## Figure 9: (Sub)mesoscale features across the lifespan of the 2018 bloom

**Methods:** The total percent of bloom values in the CHL anomaly field that 
coincided (spatially and temporarily) with each (sub)mesoscale region was 
calculated at daily intervals and represented as a time-series (Figure (9). To 
find the effect each region had on the bloom association to each (sub)mesoscale 
region, the daily background signal was subtracted from each time-series. The 
background signal was calculated by finding the total percent by day of points 
in the CHL anomaly fields that are considered bloom values.
