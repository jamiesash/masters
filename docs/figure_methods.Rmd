# Pre-Processing ---------------------------------------------------------------

## General Processing

The CZZ boarders where used as a mask to remove the coastal effects in the CHL 
SLA, and FSLE data sets. Then a CHL anomaly was calculated by removing the 
seasonal effects and long term climatologic effects from the raw CHL satellite 
signal. CHL blooms values where identified as any point greater than the median
plus the MAD per grid cell (across time) of the CHL anomaly. 

## Figure 4: HPLC against Satellite CHL Comparison and CHL Climatologies

Comparison of High-pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) bottle samples against 
the GlobColor CHL1 Lm3 satellite product. The generalized linear regression 
(family = gamma) gives an $r^2$ value of $0.454$ with a significant fit 
($p < 0.05$). Figure b) a box plot of the average monthly CHL satellite signal 
across the 18 years of data. The light grey boxes are for the region at 30N, and 
the dark grey box is for the region around Stn. ALOHA.

**Discussion:** Done

# Characterizing CHL blooms ----------------------------------------------------

## Table 1: Summary table of late summer CHL blooms in the NPSG

**Methods:** To identify when particularly large blooms occurred in an 
autonomous way, an STL filter was applied to the daily averaged time series of 
the CHL satellite data set. Bloom time periods were identified as any period 
above the mean and standard deviation of the residuals of the STL filter. 
Periods where the bloom received for shorter than 7 days where ignored and 
blooms that lasted longer than 14 days where chosen. Alternatively, start and 
end dates of the blooms where chosen manualy by viewing weekly chlorophyll maps. 
This proved to be more effective than a over engineered autonomous bloom 
identification process.

The bloom duration was found by subtracting the end from the start date. The 
magnitude was defined as the maximum value the CHL satellite signal reached at 
any point during the blooms. The bloom area was calculated as the maximum area 
the bloom reached. The center longitude and latitude locations where found by 
taking the average longitude and latitude location of each bloom point on the 
day the bloom reached it's maximum area. To mitigate the effects of clouds, the 
weekly chl product was used to find the bloom area and center. Blooms that 
occurred for less than two weeks where excluded.

## Figure 1: Monthly Composites of $CHL_{sat}$ in the NPSG

**Methods:** To generate the monthly thumbnail plots of bloom values, monthly 
composites of CHL data were used, and bloom values from the late summer months 
from June - October were plotted.  

## Figure 2: Bloom centers and maximum area

**Methods:** Bloom center from table 1 where plotted along with their maximum 
area represented as circles. The area of each circle is equal to the maximum 
area each amorphic bloom reached.

## Figure 3: Bloom duration and day of year

**Methods:** Bar plot of the bloom duration for all summer to fall blooms that 
occur between 2003-2021. Start and end date of each bloom (table 1) found using 
an STL filter. The length of each bar is equal to the duration described in 
table 1, as well as the start date of each bloom. The grey center line is the 
date each bloom reached it's maximum magnitude. Blooms lasting less than 14 days
were omitted. 

**Discussion:** While meso-scale blooms the size of Hawaii (big island) occur 
every year, blooms larger than $10,000 km^2$ occur semi-annually. These blooms 
tend to last approximately 20 - 100 days. A few blooms (2007, 2015, 2020) begin 
in the late summer, August - September, but persist until the winter where they 
are engulfed by the subtropical CHL front, making a true end date difficult to 
distinguish. Conversely some blooms notably 2005 and 2019 (Toyoda explains 
these), begin as the subtropical CHL front recedes and a true start date is 
difficult to distinguish. In some cases, 2007 and 2020 multiple large blooms 
occur in a single year. Interestingly, the maximum magnitude of each bloom 
occurs towards the XXXX or the bloom's lifespan. 

Bloom magnitudes range from 0.17 - 3.00, with a median value of $0.67 [mg/m^2]$, 
approximately $\times 4.5$ the background $1-1.5 [mg/m^3]$. Some of the stronger
blooms occurred along 32N in 2011, 2007, and 2020. The magnitude of the raw 
chlorophyll satellite signal does not taking into account the northward 
chlorophyll gradient. When considering the chlorophyll anomaly's maximum
magnitude that does correct for the northward chlorophyll gradient, the years
XXXX, XXXX had the strongest blooms which occurred at Stn. Aloha and 30N 
respectively. 

The area of the blooms range from $1.37 \times 10^4 [km^2]$ in 2012 to  
$9.43 \times 10^5 [km^2]$ in 2018. This excludes blooms less than 
$1 \times 10^5 [km^2]$ and those that are engulfed by the subtropical 
chlorophyll front. The blooms appear to cluster in three locations, that is, 
near Stn. ALOHA at [25N, -152W], at approximately [32N, 160W] and [32N, 140W]. 

# 2018 Case Study --------------------------------------------------------------

## Figure 5:  k-means cluster analysis of (sub)mesoscale regions

K-means cluster analysis (method = euclidean distance, k = 4, scale = 0-1) 
applied to the FSLE, and SLA fields at St. ALOHA during the late summer months 
(July-October) of 2018. The cluster analysis groups each data point into one of 
four (sub)mesoscale regions: mesoscale positive, mesoscale negative, 
submesoscale, and mixed regions.

## Figure 6: Two late summer CHL blooms relationship to fronts and eddies

Plankton bloom for 2019 and 2020 overlaid by FSLE and eddies. Both blooms appear 
to be associated with frontal features with little apparent association to 
mesoscale eddies.

Bloom values are chosen using the CHL anomaly. Strong frontal features  from 
FSLE satellite data are shown as black lines. Day of the year is shown in the 
top left corner of each plot.

Black and grey lines (95% confidence interval) are a GAM smoother. Figure a) 
shows the surface, figure b) shows the biomass, and figure c) shows the depth 
integrated CHL concentration.

## Figure 9: (Sub)mesoscale features across the lifespan of the 2018 bloom

Timeseries of bloom percent association (deviation from the background) of bloom 
values to cyclonic eddies, anti-cyclonic eddies and frontal features. Percent 
association is the percent of each (sub)mesoscale regionâ€™s area that is 
associated with a bloom feature.
